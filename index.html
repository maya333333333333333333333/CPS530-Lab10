        I chose to use the MaterializeCSS framework because I was told it was the easiest to use.
        To install it, I added the CDN link to MaterializeCSS in the header of my HTML file. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The making of the page itself was pretty simple. I just used a header and did some basic styling. 
        I used GitHub Pages to host the site. I created a public repository, uploaded the HTML file,
        and tweaked some settings so the page can be accessed publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hardest thing about this problem was figuring out how to host a website on GitHub. I don't use GitHub in
        my day-to-day, so I had to acquaint myself with the website first. I followed a YouTube tutorial that showed me how
        to make my page accessable.
