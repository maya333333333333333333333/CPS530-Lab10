    <h1>Problem 2</h1>

<div class="container content">
    <p>
        For this assignment, I chose the front-end framework <strong>MaterializeCSS</strong> because it is lightweight,
        easy to use, and works directly through a CDN without requiring a backend server or build process.
        To install it, I simply created an <code>index.html</code> file and added the CDN link to MaterializeCSS
        in the header. This allowed me to immediately use the framework's typography, grid system, and simple styling
        elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        To build this page, I designed a header section using a custom background color and a Google Font. Below it,
        I added a centered content block with normal paragraphs explaining the installation process, build steps,
        and challenges. GitHub Pages was used to host the site: I created a public repository, uploaded the file,
        and enabled GitHub Pages under the repository settings so the page became publicly accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the process, the main difficulty I encountered was getting GitHub Pages to serve the site correctly.
        At first, I received a 404 error because my file was not placed in the root directory and the Pages branch
        settings were incorrect. After ensuring <code>index.html</code> was in the repository root and confirming
        that GitHub Pages was set to deploy from the <strong>main branch</strong>, the site loaded successfully.
        Another small issue was ensuring that the MaterializeCSS CDN link loaded over HTTPS, as GitHub Pages requires
        secure connections, but this was solved by using the official CDN link.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, the experience provided a simple introduction to using a front-end CSS framework and deploying
        a small project using GitHub Pages.
