            <h5>1. Framework Chosen</h5>
            <p>I chose MaterializeCSS, a lightweight front-end CSS framework based on Google's Material Design guidelines.</p>

            <h5>2. How I Installed It</h5>
            <p>
                I used the CDN version. I simply added the MaterializeCSS stylesheet and script into the head of my HTML file.
                No installation or dependency manager was needed.
            </p>

            <h5>3. How I Built the Page</h5>
            <p>
                I created a simple HTML page and used Materialize components such as a navbar, container, and card.
                I also used Google Fonts to make the page look more modern.
            </p>

            <h5>4. Difficulties Encountered</h5>
            <p>
                At first, the Materialize JavaScript components were not working because I forgot to include the Materialize JS file 
                and the script was in the wrong order. After placing the script tag under the CSS link, everything started working.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also had trouble hosting the page at first because GitHub Pages only serves from a special branch or /docs folder.
                I solved this by creating a new repository, enabling GitHub Pages inside Settings → Pages, and placing my HTML file
                in the root of the repository.
